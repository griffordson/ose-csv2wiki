Knowledge and human creativity are the only non-finite resources in the world. Where the former is made artificially scarce, the latter can never reach its fullest bloom.
","Emphatically yes.

I have elementary skills and basic knowledge in a wide variety of disciplines. I am actively looking for ways to contribute with less than professional expertise any of the skill areas that this project seems to need.
","GVCS can make self-sufficiency or near self-sufficiency achievable for small communities of people. Having the necessities of life originate in the local community without diminishing technological sophistication can make human civilization more robust, adaptable, and possibly more just.

I am also enamored of the way that the GVCS proposes to make fundamental tools and techniques acquirable with minimal capital and bureaucracy. I hope that GVCS and other open-source projects will mean that in the future a person like me will have the opportunity to realize their creative potential by their own means.
","If there are tasks within existing OSE projects which could benefit from my skills and talent, I would be glad to volunteer my time.",Non-computerized information technologies.,"This is off the top of my head, just a few minutes thought, so please get your grain of salt ready:

I think that the GVCS should include surveying tools and training materials which do not rely on sophisticated electronics, modern GIS or GPS. 

Specifically, a GVCS-based community should be able to perform detailed terrain mapping without having a sophisticated IT infrastructure in place or including formally educated surveyors. It should include accessible-tech methods of soil sampling and weather monitoring.

Modeling the contour of a piece of land, it's exposure to sun, wind, and rain, soil composition, etc. is critical to sustainable agriculture and of course any kind of construction. A self-sufficient community would need to monitor changes in the terrain around them with repeated surveys.

For a GVCS-based community to ""bootstrap"" itself it must be able to plan buildings, plantings, erosion controls and such long before it is producing its own sophisticated electronics. If the village is in a non-industrialized part of the world, its citizens may not come with a deep pool of computer skills during the initial stages of GVCS-based development.
","Communication- 
Excellent written and verbal communications
Some technical writing (training materials, federal IT contracting)
1+ years dispatching/operations (airline ground servicing)
3+ years corporate training (airlines, motor freight)
2 years other training (Boy Scouts)

Organizational-
Not much, I have led teams of up to six people in an industrial setting.

Computer Support-
Nothing formal, but I am usually the guy that co-workers go to with computer problems.

Computers Generally-
A few classes; some Java, SQL, a bit more CAD

Design/Automation/Engineering/Fabrication/CNC/Product Design/Art-
I earned about 90 credits towards an Industrial Design degree before transferring.
In my current job, I have been responsible for testing prototype industrial equipment in a production setting for safety, ergonomics, and productivity.

Construction-
1+ year light construction

Industry-
5 years (approximate) between airline ground support, motor freight, light construction, snow removal, and warehouse operations.

Education- See ""Communications"" above.

Chemistry-
Undergrad general chemistry

Architecture-
6 months part-time volunteer CAD work.

Natural Building/Metallurgy/Agriculture/Energy-
A substantial amount of self-directed study, no practical experience

Finances/Video/Graphics/PR-
Essentially no experience

Other-
6+ years manual labor - I think that this is important; working with one's body is a skill. I am accustomed to doing strenuous physical work productively over long stretches of time.
Class A CDL
3 winters cold-climate industrial work (snow removal, aircraft de-icing).
2 semesters as undergraduate research assistant (neuroscience/physiological psychology)
6 months industrial research (equipment testing/modification/procedure writing)
3+ years cooking (fine dining/short-order/catering)
",Not at all yet.,"I am still working this out.

I would like to make myself available as of now for such contributory tasks as I can accomplish remotely. Anyone who reads the above ""skills"" section and thinks I could assist them on a volunteer basis, please feel free to contact me.

I would potentially like to be involved in the prototyping and testing activities at Factor e Farm on a full-time, in-person basis.
","15 hours remotely on a single project or 10 hours remotely on multiple projects (figuring for the burden of getting up to speed on each project, collaborating with a larger number of people, and frequently switching tasks).

Full time in person if I can make it financially feasible and would be fully utilized.
","Potentially, this depends on the nature of the work and the time committment involved.","Yes, eventually. I do not believe that I yet have sufficient skills in any one area to take the lead on such a project.","Yes, should the occasion arise.",Maybe,"No, insufficient funds right now.",Yes.,"Yes, eventually, after I accomplish my transition away from corporate employment.","I would very much enjoy the experience of setting up the OSE Village Experiment, but if the community persists beyond two years, I would likely wish to move on to a new challenge."

My background is in concrete foundation and masonry walls, I draft all the structural drawing that we use for permitting and construction. I  I started as a labor pouring concrete so I have hands on experience that is very useful when I'm working on a new design. 
 
Link to my construction company http://www.gcmconstruction.com/    ",I feel this is the way of the future and its a positive way to stop all the greed in this county (USA). I try to live my life by helping other and nothing expected in return   ,"because a project of this size takes a team of people to achieve. I have the CAD and a little knowledge to use it, i would like to do my part to help more people then just myself   ",Give people the tools to create a better life.  ,"3rd world work, homeless work ",,House/living areas,"Architecture- Cad Drafting and building standards (Florida Building Code) 

Construction- 11 years in concrete foundations, masonry walls, grading (Dirt), Trash collection on construction sites (dumpsters), concrete pumping.

Others- Working with the local government on different project to get approvals, a big part of this is building new bus stops on government property (lots of meetings and red tape)   ",No ,Drafting Autocad ,Yes 10-20Hrs per week ,NO ,No. I have to work to support my family and pay my bills. I wish I could ,Maybe ,not right now ,Not yet.  Will to help with CAD drawing and take it from there,"I can't quite my job, I have 28 employees and that would hurt them and there family's  ",Maybe ,I wish I could but it will not work out.

","Yes, open source in general and in any kind of field.",Watched it on TED and was amazed that this wasn't more known in this world as it is the fundamental basics for building a proper environment.,"It definitely can make changes to world issues. As mentioned in the TED video as well, buying equipment is not always the problem, maintaining is. Thus if you can build your own equipment (at a low price which is even better) and you can maintain it easily... Everybody can then use it.","Be invited, have a group of enthusiasts that want to co-work with me. I am not the best in the field but I definitely want to learn and spread the knowledge I learn from it.","Maybe I have missed it, but as I like 3D design a lot and frankly I am not so good at it I did not found proper information on what was used for creating the schematics, what was missing, and where is it all located.","Have some good standards for the end results, and a good synchronization box where everything can be properly exchanged and maintained.","I can contribute in computer support, design, schematics, web interfaces.",I am currently present at the forum but this is still at a low level.,"I would love to work on designing parts as I also would like to learn from it. A good setup in the IT branch, I should be able to help in there as well.

Also I do have some mechanic skills as I am currently restoring my old beetle but this is not at a professional level","I definitely can, depending on the enthusiasm and the projects to work on this can vary from a few hours a week to much more.","Yes, as everybody is but to be honest leave this for later.","In the future perhaps, depending on how this all kicks off.",Not yet,I'll save this for later,"Yes, but not in the way of money at the moment as I am currently a student.",As I have my own field where I love to work on and as this is not exactly what the OSE is about I have to say no on this part.,"Yes, as my father has a small farm it would be nice to be able to use some developments directly.","As I assume that this community will be located in america, then this is not an option for me (besides the visa and such)."
